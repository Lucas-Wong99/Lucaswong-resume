      <div>
      <p>    I was born on April 18th, 1999, and raised in North  Vancouver for my entire childhood.
         I am now 20 years old and  am currently enrolling in Lighthouse Labs' Intro to Front-End with
          Javascript course. My whole life has been based around being a student athlete. I have
           played almost every sport you can think of from, tennis to hockey. For the past three
           years I've only focused on my hockey dream, taking two gap years while playing competitive
            hockey at the Junior A level. Now I'm ready to dive into school and associate all of the
             life lessons and skills I've learned from sports, towards choosing the career path I
             want to follow.</p>

          <p>I consider myself a die hard foodie. I love cooking food, and not just because the rumors that say if you make it yourself it tastes better, are true.
             I love how food brings people together and the only types of food I dislike are mushrooms and olives.</p>
